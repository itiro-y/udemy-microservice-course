# Udemy Microservices Course

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a modular microservices system. You will start with a solid foundation of concepts: what microservices are, why they exist, and how they work. Next, you will move on to hands-on practice by building your first microservice and gradually advancing to a more robust distributed system.
